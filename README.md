# 8-bit_BCD_Multiplier_using_Double_Dabble_Method
This project implements an 8-bit BCD multiplier using Verilog HDL. Multiplication of two unsigned 8-bit numbers is performed using the Shift and Add method. The binary multiplication result is then converted to its BCD (Binary Coded Decimal) format using the Double Dabble algorithm. Both Binary and BCD outputs are generated and verified.
